# Code Review Agent System

The Code Review Agent System is an intelligent, automated solution designed to streamline the code review process. This system leverages AI agents to analyze code, provide insightful feedback, and facilitate collaboration between developers.

The system consists of multiple specialized agents working together:
- A Supervisor Agent that coordinates all activities
- A GitHub Agent that interfaces with pull requests and merge requests
- An R&D Agent that accesses git history and uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context
- A Code Review Agent that performs detailed code analysis and generates review comments

By automating routine aspects of code review, this system helps development teams:
- Improve code quality through consistent and thorough reviews
- Reduce the time spent on manual reviews
- Accelerate the development cycle
- Ensure coding standards are maintained

## Workflow Steps Diagram
The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete workflow of the code review system, from initial request to final delivery of review results. It shows how the different agents interact with each other and the sequence of operations performed during a code review process.

The workflow demonstrates:
- How user requests are processed by the Supervisor Agent
- The information gathering phase through the GitHub Agent
- Parallel processing of context and code analysis
- The consolidation of feedback from multiple sources
- The delivery of comprehensive review results back to the user
  This orchestrated approach ensures efficient processing while maintaining thorough analysis of the code under review.

    participant User
    participant SA as Supervisor Agent
    participant GH as GitHub Agent
    participant RD as R&D Agent
    participant CR as Code Review Agent

    User->>SA: Submit Code Review Request
    
    %% Step 1: Initial Processing
    SA->>GH: Request MR Details
    GH-->>SA: Return MR Information
    
    %% Step 2: Parallel Processing
    par Parallel Analysis
        SA->>RD: Request Historical Context
        SA->>CR: Request Code Analysis
    end
    
    %% Step 3: R&D Agent Processing
    RD->>RD: Query Git Repository
    RD->>RD: Process RAG Data
    RD-->>SA: Return Context & Patterns
    
    %% Step 4: Code Review Processing
    CR->>CR: Analyze Code
    CR->>CR: Check Standards
    CR->>CR: Identify Issues
    CR-->>SA: Return Review Results
    
    %% Step 5: Consolidation
    SA->>SA: Consolidate Feedback
    
    %% Step 6: Posting Results
    SA->>GH: Post Review Comments
    GH->>GH: Update MR
    
    %% Step 7: Final Response
    SA-->>User: Provide Review Summary
```

This sequence diagram shows:
1. Initial user request
2. Supervisor Agent coordination
3. GitHub Agent MR retrieval
4. Parallel processing by R&D and Code Review agents
5. Detailed steps within each agent
6. Result consolidation
7. Final feedback posting and user notification
